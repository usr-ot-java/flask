"""!!answer In Python, it is generally not considered good practice to import modules or libraries inside an if statement. Python import statements are typically placed at the top of a file.
Placing imports inside an if statement can make the code less readable and can potentially cause issues related to importing the same module multiple times in different parts of the code.
So, it is better to keep import statements at the top of the file.
